# 🚀 7-Day Portfolio Challenge – Day 1  

This repository is part of my **7-day challenge to sharpen my development skills and strengthen my portfolio**.  
On **Day 1**, I kicked off the challenge by setting up this repo and planning the backend project.

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Developers often build projects but don’t always structure them with clarity, features, and documentation.  
This project is aimed at creating a **well-structured, production-like backend system** that reflects good practices in design, code quality, and project organization.  

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)  
- User Authentication (Signup, Login, JWT)  
- CRUD Operations (Tasks/Notes)  
- Secure APIs with validation  
- Database Integration (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)  
- Bonus: Role-based access or categories/tags  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose) / PostgreSQL (Prisma)  
- **Authentication:** JWT, Bcrypt  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman

⚡ Stay tuned: I’ll be pushing progress every day for 7 days.
